4>//Discuss different methods for connecting to a database in PHP. Describe the differences
between MySQLi and PDO. Provide an example of how to perform a basic database query
using one of these methods.//

There are several methods in PHP for connecting to databases, 
two of which are MySQLi (MySQL Improved) and PDO (PHP Data Objects). 
Both allow PHP to interact with databases, but they differ in their usage and features.

MySQLi (MySQL Improved): 
Procedural and Object-Oriented Interfaces: 
MySQLi provides procedural and object-oriented interfaces.
MySQL-specific terminology: Specifically designed for MySQL database interactions.
Supports Prepared Statements and Transactions: Allows for the creation of prepared statements and transactions, 
which improves security and integrity.
Native Stored Procedure Support: Offers native support for stored procedures in MySQL databases.
Fully Equipped: Provides additional features for managing MySQL features.
PHP Data Objects (PDO):
Database Agnostic: Works with a variety of database management systems other than MySQL. 
It supports a variety of databases, including MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQLite, and others.

// Database connection
$dsn = 'mysql:host=localhost; dbname=customers; charset=utf8';
$username = 'username';
$password = 'password';

try {
    $pdo = new PDO($dsn, $username, $password);

    // Set PDO error mode to exception
    $pdo->setAttribute(PDO::ATTR_ERRMODE, PDO::ERRMODE_EXCEPTION);

    // query
    $sql = "SELECT * FROM users";

    // SQL statement
    $statement = $pdo->prepare($sql);

    // Execute statement
    $statement->execute();

    // Fetch all rows
    $result = $statement->fetchAll(PDO::FETCH_ASSOC);

    //  fetched data
    foreach ($result as $row) {
        echo "Name: {$row['name']} - Email: {$row['email']}<br>";
    }
} catch (PDOException $e) {
    // Handle database connection errors
    echo "Connection failed: " . $e->getMessage();
}

This code establishes a connection to a MySQL database using PDO, 
prepares and executes a simple SQL query to retrieve data from a table
